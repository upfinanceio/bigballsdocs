# ðŸ˜± Defense Against Scammers

Scammers have no balls whatsoever and we will do our best to fight them. Nevertheless we cannot always completely stop them from entering our chatrooms. Here are some rules for communication we use so that scammers have less chance. Please read them.

* We will never suddenly post a link in our socials with the promise of an airdrop or whatever. If any one of us posts such a link, our account has been compromised. Do not click it!
* If we have a special and unique event that would work differently from the normal way our protocol works, we will announce it in advance and well explained. If that hasn't happened, be careful.
* We, the team, have our appropriate roles assigned in our Discord. If someone DM's you, saying they are a support agent, do not believe them and report them to us as scammers in the relevant channel with a screenshot please. We'll ban them as soon as we can. Please be aware that accounts can be very convincingly faked.
* If you need actual help, we have a ticket system in our Discord. Please use that.
* If anyone of our team or any of our mods behave suspiciously, please report that too with screenshots.
* If you see a duplicate of our site or you see suspicious on-chain activity that you think we should know about, please let us know.
* Telegram will be much less organized than our discord so there will be more opportunities for scammers there in direct messages so take caution

Defi is a wild place and transactions are final. Please help us make it safer by acting smart.
