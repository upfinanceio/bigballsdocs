# üè¶ Staking

Staking $BALLS in Big Balls Capital is how you show you have the balls to make it this cycle. By staking, you convert $BALLS into $bigBALLS, locking in your tokens to grow as the treasury expands. Staking is straightforward‚Äîjust stake, sit back, and watch your $bigBALLS multiply through compounding rewards. The method of compounding is called rebasing explained below.&#x20;

### **Rebasing**

Rebasing is Big Balls Capital‚Äôs built-in compounding mechanism, allowing staked $bigBALLS holders to passively grow their holdings. Every 8 hours, a rebase increases your $bigBALLS balance by ‚Öì the displayed daily percentage rate, maintaining or growing your share of the treasury as the protocol grows. Rebasing means that, as the value of Big Balls Capital‚Äôs treasury rises, so does your balance‚Äîeffortlessly.&#x20;

In essence, rebasing in Big Balls Capital is about having the balls to stay invested. Each rebase rewards you with increased ownership, ensuring you benefit from the protocol‚Äôs growth over those that lack the balls to stake.

Once you no longer have balls you can of course unstake your rewards and redeem your $BALLS for the underlying treasury.
