# ðŸª™ Tokenomics

Big Balls Capitalâ€™s tokenomics are crafted to reward those who have the Balls to stick with the protocol through crypto market volatility while maintaining a strong treasury foundation to grow exponentially over time.&#x20;

*   **$BALLS**: The main protocol token, representing a share of the treasury and capable of being staked for rewards.

    * Initial Supply of 10,000,000 $BALLS
    * The design of the protocol is to incentivize long term holding of $BALLS and effectively leverage the volatility and overwhelming hype/growth potential of memes and AI coins
      * &#x20;Treasury growth from coin mania will cause a flywheel of Bonding (further increasing treasury) and buy pressure of $BALLS to catch up with the backing
    * $BALLS supply inflates while rebasing is active please see [Staking](../mechanics/staking.md) for more info on the rebase mechanic that increases the supply and rewards stakers for securing tokens and creating a position in $bigBALLS
    * Team is allocated 10% of the initial supply used for expenses, marketing, pay, bribes and will be staked


* **$bigBALLS**: The staked version of $BALLS, growing automatically via compounding daily and representing a committed stake in the protocolâ€™s future.
  * Staking $BALLS for $bigBALLS ensures that your share of the treasury is maintained or grows over time, this is in comparison to simply holding $BALLS which results in your share being diluted by $bigBALLS holders over time
  * How big are your balls anon

### **Big Balls Capital Fees:**

*   **Sell Tax**: Up to a 10% tax on sales&#x20;

    * This is to prevent of rebase exploitation (i.e. buying before rebase and selling after)
    * Deters Jeets with no balls from constant selling and rewards holding and staking $BALLS
    * Taxes will be used for the benefit of the protocol (i.e. bribing on Aerodrome to incentivize a gauge)
    * Deflate circulating supply and enable the ability for treasury to create more Bonds without inflation of supply increasing treasury relative to supply
    * Tax can be reduced from 10% and maybe removed depending on market conditions


*   **Redemption Fee**: A 0-10% fee applies when redeeming $BALLS for the underlying treasury assets, ensuring stability and alignment with the protocolâ€™s vision.

    * Initial redemption fee is 5% to ensure treasury growth and will be adjusted to align with the health of the protocol to keep the treasury strong. Fee can be reduced to 0 in the future.
    * Holding and staking $BALLS gives a direct ownership of the treasury that can be redeemed for the underlying assets, this directly creates a floor price of $BALLS which it cannot go below
    * In the two weeks of launch no redemptions will be active so the treasury can build and positions can be made, $BALLS can be sold on market if you wish to exit at this time
    * $BALLS are burnt during redemption deflating supply
